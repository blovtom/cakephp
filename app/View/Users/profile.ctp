By itself, WordPress is a very powerful program for Web publishing, but by customizing WordPress with plugins —
add-on programs that give WordPress almost limitless ways to handle Web content — you can make it even more powerful.
 You can choose any plugins you need to expand your online possibilities.

Plugins can turn your WordPress installation into a full featured gallery for posting images on the Web,
an online store to sell your products, a user forum, or a social-networking site.
WordPress plugins can be simple, adding (say) a few minor features to your blog,
or they can be complex enough to change your entire WordPress site’s functionality.
